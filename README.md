# udemy-created

This project is a very basic command-line tool with one function, to get the date of when a udemy course was created.

---

There was two reasons for creating this simple command-line.

1. Experimenting with some web scraping using golang
2. Solve the unseemingly tedious problem to get the creation date of a udemy course
